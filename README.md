# snipman
Very old snippet manager using SQLite for storage

Written between 2009 and 2012 using WinForms, C# and SQLite.
It stores snippets organized in a treeview and displays them with SharpDevelop's really old text editor (not Avalon)

I've used it personally for storing bits and pieces since I wrote it, but recently not so much.

Being one of my first C# projects, the code is quite messy. Never bothered by it enough to clean it up.
